                GraphicsWindow.Width = 200 
GraphicsWindow.Height = 200 
GraphicsWindow.PenColor = "Green" 
GraphicsWindow.DrawLine(10, 10, 100, 100) 
GraphicsWindow.PenColor = "Gold" 
GraphicsWindow.DrawLine(10, 100, 100,
                'next token or line'
                Complete the 'next token or line' part of the code three times in the Small Basic programming language. Just show your three probable answers in place of 'next token or line'.
